# Math3_tud
Containing some most common algorithms in regard to the lecture about mathe3@TUD (numeric &amp; statistic)

This is a projekt start for fun by myself since i am struggling with the focus during the calculation. So in order to make my life easier i wrote these functions to check whether i did the calculation correct or not (ofc not with 100% certainty since some of them are non-linear prolems).
