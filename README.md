# Math3_tud
Containing some most common algorithms in regard to the lecture about mathe3@TUD (numeric &amp; statistic)

This is a project start for fun by myself since I am struggling with the focus during the calculation. So in order to make my life easier I wrote these functions to check whether I did the calculation correctly or not (ofc not with 100% certainty since a lot of them are non-linear problems).
